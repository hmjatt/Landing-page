                        <h3>Introduction to Computer Programming</h3>
                        <p><strong>Level: </strong>1</p>
                        <p><strong>Course Code: </strong>CST8116</p>
                        <p><strong>Description: </strong>
                            Possessing the fundamentals of logic, problem-solving and programming language structure
                            provides a solid foundation for further study in the field. Students develop introductory
                            knowledge of computer programming with emphasis on problem analysis and design, using
                            algorithms, pseudocode, flowcharts, UML Class Diagrams and testing, with the Java
                            programming language used as a means to implement problem solution designs. Through an
                            introduction to the Java programming language students use sequential structures, selection
                            structures, repetition structures, variables, constants, methods, constructors,
                            one-dimensional arrays, object-oriented programming, classes, objects, abstraction,
                            encapsulation, inputs, outputs, coding conventions and documentation. Theory is reinforced
                            with application by means of practical laboratory assessments.

                        <p><strong>Description: </strong>
                            Database systems can automate data processing tasks as well as tie into the security of
                            information technology systems. Students acquire practical experience using market-leading
                            object-relational database management systems like Oracle and MySQL. Students obtain
                            hands-on experience with advanced engineering modeling tools along with SQL, SQL scripts and
                            programming with Oracle's PL/SQL blocks. Database concepts covered include advanced SQL,
                            case structures, rollup and cube operations, metadata manipulation, data storage and
                            retrieval, security and transaction control and data warehousing </p>

                        <p><strong>Course Code: </strong>CST8288</p>
                        <p><strong>Description: </strong>
                            Design patterns are programming architecture solutions to common challenges faced in
                            software implementation. Students implement best practices of object-oriented program
                            development with software design patterns. Students also apply Unified Modeling Language
                            (UML) program specifications in the Java programming language. SQL through JDBC technology
                            is used embedded for developing and using "data access objects". Course topics include
                            refactoring, domain modelling, JDBC and multithreaded servlet programming. Students develop
                            proficiency in creating, testing, debugging, deploying and documenting programs and servlets
                            through practical application.

                        <p><strong>Course Code: </strong>CST8277</p>
                        <p><strong>Description: </strong>
                            Enterprise applications connect clients to services that are based on data stored in
                            database management systems. With a focus on the IT Enterprise, students examine the
                            application enterprise environment using and extending the technologies learned in previous
                            courses. Students examine the commonly used enterprise systems development technologies such
                            as Java/Jakarta Enterprise Edition, cloud computing, security and the corporate database
                            repository.
